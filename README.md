# My Advent of Code Solutions
## Introduction
The **year 2022** was my first year where I was introduced to this event, thanks to [vvaper](https://github.com/vvarper), 
who at that moment was my 'Data Structures' teacher and who I thank the most for boosting my learning skills and participating in this event. 
The purpose of the Advent that year (2022) was to compete against the teacher's to prove that the alumni we're better :stuck_out_tongue: (we didn't even come close haha).

At that time (2022), I was a 2 year student in Computer Engineering, so I only really knew how to code in C++, 
so my chances werent very high at winning, but my **focus** was to **increase my programming skills**, which helped my big time.

At the time I'm writting this, it's **year 2023**, and the purpose of this year is to **learn Python**, 
so I will be trying to complete this year's Advent (2023) in Python while also, of course, **boosting my competitive programming and problem solving skills**

## What's the purpose of this repository?
The purpose really, is to **get better at coding in C++ and Python**, these events are great because they help me **improve in problem solving** problems and 
learn to break down problems into smaller parts.
