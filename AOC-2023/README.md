# My Advent Of Code Solutions for 2023
## Introduction
This year, my focus is to **learn Python** and get better with it.
These events usually are really good to have more experience using 
data structures and problem solving.

Last year I had a tough time with C++, but despite the obnoxious syntax and errors,
 I got much better at programming in C++ and developed quite the problem solving, so I'm hoping the same will apply to Python.
 
 As always, this is for fun (sometimes) :smile:
